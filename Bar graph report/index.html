                        Instead of following the traditional approach of
                        first creating an investment portfolio and then
                        using the returns from it to meet goals as they
                        arise, it is more effective to first identify goals
                        at different stages of his life and then fund and
                        invest for each goal separately based on the
                        time horizon and risk profile.
